Introduction

Hey there! This guide explains how to obtain free testnet tokens (ETH or MATIC) needed for testing the Academic Document Blockchain Verification System. Testnet tokens have no real-world value and are used exclusively for testing blockchain applications.

Why Do You Need Testnet Tokens?

For Issuers:
- Register documents on the blockchain
- Pay gas fees for transactions
- Test the system before production

For Developers:
- Deploy smart contracts
- Test blockchain interactions
- Develop and debug applications

Important: Testnet tokens are FREE and have NO monetary value. Never pay for testnet tokens!

Mainnet:
- Real blockchain network
- Real cryptocurrency with value
- Costs real money
- Used for production

Testnet:
- Test blockchain network

Best Practices

Managing Testnet Tokens

1. Request Wisely:
   - Only request what you need
   - Don't hoard testnet tokens
   - Leave some for others

2. Track Usage:
   - Monitor your balance
   - Request more before running out
   - Keep at least 0.1 ETH/MATIC for emergencies

3. Multiple Wallets:
   - Create separate wallet for testing
   - Don't mix testnet and mainnet wallets
   - Clearly label testnet wallets

Security

1. Never Share Private Keys:
   - Testnet or mainnet
   - Even for testing
   - Use separate test wallets

2. Don't Pay for Testnet Tokens:
   - All testnet tokens are FREE
   - Anyone asking for payment is a scam
   - Report scams to community

3. Verify Faucet URLs:
   - Use official faucet links
   - Check for HTTPS
   - Beware of phishing sites

Efficiency

1. Batch Operations:
   - Request tokens before starting work
   - Plan your testing
   - Minimize transaction count

2. Gas Optimization:
   - Use appropriate gas limits
   - Don't overpay for gas
   - Test gas estimation

3. Network Selection:
   - Use Sepolia for Ethereum testing
   - Use Mumbai for Polygon testing
   - Choose based on your needs
