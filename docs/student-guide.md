## Introduction

Welcome to the Student Guide for the Academic Document Blockchain Verification System. This guide will help you understand how to access, manage, and share your blockchain-verified academic credentials.

### What is Blockchain Verification?

Your academic documents (degrees, certificates, transcripts) are registered on a blockchain - a secure, tamper-proof digital ledger. This means:

**Benefits for You:**
- **Instant Verification**: Employers can verify your credentials in seconds
- **Global Recognition**: Your documents can be verified from anywhere in the world
- **Permanent Record**: Your credentials are stored permanently and cannot be lost
- **No Forgery**: Blockchain technology prevents document tampering
- **Easy Sharing**: Share your credentials with a simple link or QR code
- **Privacy Control**: You decide who can access your documents

### How It Works

```
1. Your Institution Issues Document
   ↓
2. Document Registered on Blockchain
   ↓
3. You Receive Verified Document with QR Code
   ↓
4. Share with Employers/Universities
   ↓
5. They Verify Instantly
```

### What You Need

**Required:**
- Email address (provided by your institution)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my document secure on the blockchain?**
A: Yes, very secure. The document itself is encrypted and stored on IPFS. Only the document's cryptographic hash (fingerprint) is on the blockchain. This means your document cannot be accessed without permission, but anyone can verify its authenticity.

**Q: Can my document be tampered with or forged?**
A: No. Once registered on the blockchain, the record is permanent and cannot be changed. Any modification to the document would change its hash, making it immediately detectable.

**Q: Do I need cryptocurrency to use this system?**
A: No. As a student, you don't need any cryptocurrency. Your institution handles all blockchain transactions. You only need cryptocurrency if you want to perform advanced operations like transferring document ownership.

**Q: What if I lose my document file?**
A: You can always download it again from the student portal or request it from your institution. The blockchain record is permanent, so your credentials are never truly lost.

**Q: Can I edit or update my document?**
A: No, blockchain records are immutable. If there's an error, your institution must issue a corrected document and register it as a new document. The original remains in the blockchain for audit purposes.

**Q: How long does verification take?**
A: Instant! Verification happens in seconds. The blockchain lookup is nearly instantaneous.

**Q: Is this recognized internationally?**
A: Yes. Blockchain verification works globally. Any employer or institution worldwide can verify your credentials instantly, regardless of location.

**Q: What happens if the website goes down?**
A: Your documents are safe. The blockchain record is permanent and distributed across thousands of computers. Even if the website is down, the blockchain record remains, and verification can be done through alternative methods.

### Privacy Questions

**Q: Who can see my documents?**
A: Only people you explicitly share with can see your document details. The blockchain only contains a hash (fingerprint) of your document, not the document itself. Anyone can verify the hash, but they need the actual document to do so.

**Q: Can I control who verifies my documents?**
A: You can't prevent verification (that's the point - employers need to verify), but you control who has direct access to your documents through the portal. All verifications are logged so you can see who verified your credentials.

**Q: Is my personal information on the blockchain?**
A: Only basic information like your name, student ID, and document details are on the blockchain. Sensitive information like your date of birth, address, or social security number are NOT on the blockchain.

**Q: Can I delete my documents?**
A: The blockchain record cannot be deleted (that's what makes it tamper-proof). However, you can request your institution to mark the document as revoked, and you can delete your account from the portal.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What blockchain is used?**
A: The system uses Ethereum (Sepolia testnet for testing, mainnet for production) or Polygon. These are well-established, secure blockchain networks.

**Q: What is IPFS?**
A: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized storage network where your encrypted documents are stored. It's like cloud storage, but distributed across many computers for redundancy and security.

**Q: What is a document hash?**
A: A hash is a unique cryptographic fingerprint of your document. Even a tiny change to the document creates a completely different hash. This is how we detect tampering.

**Q: Do I need to pay gas fees?**
A: No. Your institution pays the gas fees (blockchain transaction costs) when registering your document. You don't pay anything.

**Q: What if I want to transfer my document to someone else?**
A: Document ownership can be transferred, but this requires blockchain interaction and should only be done with your institution's approval. Contact your institution for guidance.

### Sharing Questions

**Q: How many times can I share my document?**
A: Unlimited. You can share your verification link or QR code as many times as you want with as many people as you want.

**Q: Can I share with multiple employers at once?**
A: Yes. Each employer can verify independently. There's no limit to how many organizations can verify your document.

**Q: What if an employer doesn't understand blockchain verification?**
A: The verification process is designed to be simple. They just click your link or scan your QR code. The verification page explains everything clearly. You can also direct them to the verifier guide.

**Q: Can I customize what information is shared?**
A: The verification shows all information registered on the blockchain. You cannot hide specific fields. However, you can choose whether to grant direct portal access (which shows more details) or just share the verification link (which shows basic information).
